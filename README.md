### Lastmile — an AI-Powered Parametric Income Protection for Quick-Commerce Riders

Lastmile is a mobile-first parametric insurance platform that protects quick-commerce delivery riders from income loss caused by verified external disruptions.

### Problem Statement:  
Quick-commerce delivery riders are an essential part of urban delivery ecosystem. Their earnings depend on continuous order flow, active working hours, and access to operational delivery zones. 
However, external disruptions such as heavy rain, flooding, waterlogging, severe AQI, heatwaves, dark-store shutdowns, and platform outages can sharply reduce their ability to work and earn.

These disruptions are outside the rider’s control, yet they directly impact short-term income. 
Existing insurance systems do not address this specific problem well, because they are generally designed around health, life, accident, or asset protection rather than real-time, disruption-linked income loss.

This creates a gap in protection for gig workers whose income is volatile, weekly in nature, and highly sensitive to external operating conditions.


## Persona Selection

1) What is our chosen persona?:  
Our chosen persona is quick-commerce delivery riders working with platforms like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart.

2) Why did we choose this persona?:  
We chose this group because they seem like the best fit for the kind of product we want to build.
Their work is very time-sensitive and depends on constant order flow within a small delivery area.
If something goes wrong in that area, like heavy rain, flooding, bad AQI, a dark store shutting down, or even a platform issue, their earnings can drop almost immediately.
That makes this problem much easier to identify, measure, and solve through a weekly income-protection model.

3) What is the estimated user base?:  
Exact rider-only numbers are not always publicly available. But the overall scale of the quick-commerce workforce is already very large.
ET Retail reported in November 2024, citing TeamLease Services, that Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart were expected to collectively employ more than 4 lakh people by March 2025 as they expanded their dark store operations.
Even though this includes broader workforce numbers and not just riders, it still shows how large this ecosystem already is.

4) What is the market opportunity?:  
The market itself is growing fast, which makes this a strong long-term opportunity.
BCG reported in 2025 that rapid commerce in India could become a $20+ billion GMV opportunity by 2030, supported by a $2+ billion logistics market. Mordor Intelligence also estimates that the India quick-commerce market will grow from $3.65 billion in 2026 to $6.64 billion by 2031.
This tells us that the sector is not only growing, but also creating room for support systems and financial protection products built specifically for workers in this space.

5) What shows that this segment will keep growing?:  
There are already strong signs of rapid growth. Bain reported that quick-commerce GMV in India grew four times between 2022 and 2024. BCG also pointed out that the category is expected to grow at more than 45% annually.
That kind of expansion means more riders, more delivery density, and more dependence on this workforce, which also means stronger need for income protection solutions.

6) Why is this persona the best fit for our product?:  
For our use case, this persona makes the most sense. The rider works in a defined area, the earning loss happens quickly when disruptions occur, and the events affecting them can be tracked in a more reliable way.
That makes it easier for us to build a product that is simple to explain, practical to use, and realistic to automate. It also makes fraud checks more manageable because we can match claims against location, activity, and actual disruption events.

## Frontend Stack and Initial Build Approach

For the frontend, we plan to build the mobile app using **React Native with Expo and TypeScript**. This gives us a strong base for building a mobile-first product quickly while still keeping the code structured and scalable. Expo is designed for building Android, iOS, and web apps from a single JavaScript/TypeScript project, which makes it a practical choice for a product that may later expand beyond a single-device demo.

We intend to use **TypeScript** to keep the frontend code more organized and easier to scale as the app grows. Since the app includes multiple user flows such as onboarding, profile setup, quote generation, policy activation, claims, and payouts, having typed components, typed API responses, and structured navigation will help keep the frontend more maintainable over time. Expo’s current documentation supports TypeScript as a standard part of the development workflow. 

For navigation, we plan to structure the app around screen-based routing using **React Navigation** or **Expo Router**, depending on what fits the final code structure best. React Navigation is well-suited for managing transitions between screens, bottom tabs, stacks, and nested navigation flows, which matches the type of app flow we have already designed. Expo Router is also a strong option because it brings file-based routing to Expo and React Native projects, making it easier to organize larger screen structures cleanly. :

Our current frontend idea is to divide the app into clear stages:
- authentication flow
- onboarding flow
- quote and plan selection
- main dashboard flow
- claims and payouts flow
- profile and settings

This structure will allow us to keep the user journey clear while also making the frontend easier to manage during development.

For session handling, the app will remember the currently logged-in rider unless the account is changed or logged out. Sensitive session data such as tokens will be stored securely on-device using **Expo SecureStore**, which is designed for encrypted local key-value storage. React Native’s security guidance also recommends avoiding unencrypted local storage for sensitive credentials. 

For non-sensitive frontend state such as app preferences, lightweight cached state, or temporary UI persistence, we may use local persistent storage separately from secure auth storage. Expo documents Async Storage as a suitable unencrypted persistent key-value store for data that does not require encryption. 

At the frontend level, the app will mainly be responsible for:
- collecting rider information
- rendering quotes and policy details
- displaying claims and payout states
- managing user sessions
- sending API requests to the backend
- receiving and displaying backend-calculated pricing, claim status, and protection details

This means the frontend remains focused on user experience and state management, while the heavy logic such as pricing, risk scoring, fraud checks, and policy decisions stays on the server side.

In the initial build phase, the frontend will likely be organized into reusable components for:
- forms
- plan cards
- claim status cards
- payout summaries
- dashboard widgets
- navigation layouts

This will help us move from wireframes to a scalable mobile app structure without tightly coupling UI code to backend logic.
