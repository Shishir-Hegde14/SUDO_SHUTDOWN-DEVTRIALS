### Lastmile — an AI-Powered Parametric Income Protection for Quick-Commerce Riders

Lastmile is a mobile-first parametric insurance platform that protects quick-commerce delivery riders from income loss caused by verified external disruptions.

### Problem Statement:  
Quick-commerce delivery riders are an essential part of urban delivery ecosystem. Their earnings depend on continuous order flow, active working hours, and access to operational delivery zones. 
However, external disruptions such as heavy rain, flooding, waterlogging, severe AQI, heatwaves, dark-store shutdowns, and platform outages can sharply reduce their ability to work and earn.

These disruptions are outside the rider’s control, yet they directly impact short-term income. 
Existing insurance systems do not address this specific problem well, because they are generally designed around health, life, accident, or asset protection rather than real-time, disruption-linked income loss.

This creates a gap in protection for gig workers whose income is volatile, weekly in nature, and highly sensitive to external operating conditions.


## Persona Selection

1) What is our chosen persona?:  
Our chosen persona is quick-commerce delivery riders working with platforms like Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart.

2) Why did we choose this persona?:  
We chose this group because they seem like the best fit for the kind of product we want to build.
Their work is very time-sensitive and depends on constant order flow within a small delivery area.
If something goes wrong in that area, like heavy rain, flooding, bad AQI, a dark store shutting down, or even a platform issue, their earnings can drop almost immediately.
That makes this problem much easier to identify, measure, and solve through a weekly income-protection model.

3) What is the estimated user base?:  
Exact rider-only numbers are not always publicly available. But the overall scale of the quick-commerce workforce is already very large.
ET Retail reported in November 2024, citing TeamLease Services, that Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart were expected to collectively employ more than 4 lakh people by March 2025 as they expanded their dark store operations.
Even though this includes broader workforce numbers and not just riders, it still shows how large this ecosystem already is.

4) What is the market opportunity?:  
The market itself is growing fast, which makes this a strong long-term opportunity.
BCG reported in 2025 that rapid commerce in India could become a $20+ billion GMV opportunity by 2030, supported by a $2+ billion logistics market. Mordor Intelligence also estimates that the India quick-commerce market will grow from $3.65 billion in 2026 to $6.64 billion by 2031.
This tells us that the sector is not only growing, but also creating room for support systems and financial protection products built specifically for workers in this space.

5) What shows that this segment will keep growing?:  
There are already strong signs of rapid growth. Bain reported that quick-commerce GMV in India grew four times between 2022 and 2024. BCG also pointed out that the category is expected to grow at more than 45% annually.
That kind of expansion means more riders, more delivery density, and more dependence on this workforce, which also means stronger need for income protection solutions.

6) Why is this persona the best fit for our product?:  
For our use case, this persona makes the most sense. The rider works in a defined area, the earning loss happens quickly when disruptions occur, and the events affecting them can be tracked in a more reliable way.
That makes it easier for us to build a product that is simple to explain, practical to use, and realistic to automate. It also makes fraud checks more manageable because we can match claims against location, activity, and actual disruption events.


## Proposed Solution

## Frontend and Mobile App Flow

Our product is designed as a **mobile-first app** for quick-commerce delivery riders. The frontend is centered around a simple rider journey: onboarding, plan selection, coverage visibility, claims tracking, and payout status.

For the frontend, we plan to use **React Native + Expo + TypeScript**. This gives us a strong cross-platform setup for mobile development while keeping the code organized and scalable. For navigation, we plan to use **React Navigation** or **Expo Router**, depending on the final screen structure. Sensitive session data such as login tokens will be stored securely using **Expo SecureStore**.

### 1. Authentication

This is the entry point for both first-time and returning users.

**Screens**

## Backend System and Processing Flow

The backend is designed as a **service-oriented system** that handles all core logic, automation, and integrations. It powers pricing, disruption detection, claim generation, and payouts, while the frontend focuses on user experience and interaction.

The system communicates with the frontend through **secure REST APIs** and processes all business logic, validations, and external data integrations required for real-time income protection.

This is the entry point for all requests coming from the mobile app.

**Responsibilities**
- handle incoming API requests
- validate request structure
- authenticate users using JWT tokens
- route requests to the correct services

**Flow**

---

### 2. User and Profile Service

This service manages all rider-related data collected during onboarding.

**Data stored**
- personal details
- work profile (platform, vehicle type)
- delivery zones and location
- working hours and availability

**Purpose**
